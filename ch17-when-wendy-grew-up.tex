\chapter{When Wendy Grew Up}

As you look at Wendy,
you may see her hair becoming white,
and her figure little again,
for all this happened long ago.
Jane is now a common grown-up,
with a daughter called Margaret;
and every spring cleaning time,
except when he forgets,
Peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland,
where she tells him stories about himself,
to which he listens eagerly.
When Margaret grows up she will have a daughter,
who is to be Peterâ€™s mother in turn;
and thus it will go on,
so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.
