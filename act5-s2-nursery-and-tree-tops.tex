In a sort of way he understands what she means by ‘Yes, I know,’
but in most sorts of ways he doesn’t.
It has something to do with the riddle of his being.
If he could get the hang of the thing his cry might become
‘To live would be an awfully big adventure!\@’
but he can never quite get the hang of it,
and so no one is as gay as he.
With rapturous face he produces his pipes,
and the Never birds and the fairies gather closer,
till the roof of the little house is so thick with his admirers
that some of them fall down the chimney.
He plays on and on till we wake up.)
