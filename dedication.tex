\section[Dedication: To the Five]{To the Five\\A Dedication}

Some disquieting confessions must be made in printing at last the play of \emph{Peter Pan};
among them this, that I have no recollection of having written it.
Of that, however, anon.
What I want to do first is to give Peter to the Five without whom he never would have existed.
I hope, my dear sirs,
that in memory of what we have been to each other
you will accept this dedication with your friend’s love.
The play of Peter is streaky with you still,
though none may see this save ourselves.
A score of Acts had to be left out, and you were in them all.
We first brought Peter down, didn’t we, with a blunt-headed arrow in Kensington Gardens?
I seem to remember that we believed we had killed him,
though he was only winded,
and that after a spasm of exultation in our prowess
the more soft hearted among us wept and all of us thought of the police.
There was not one of you who would not have sworn as an eye-witness to this occurrence;
no doubt I was abetting,
but you used to provide corroboration that was never given to you by me.
As for myself,
I suppose I always knew that I made Peter by rubbing the five of you violently together,
as savages with two sticks produce a flame.
That is all he is, the spark I got from you.
