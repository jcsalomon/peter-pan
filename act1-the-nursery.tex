\Act{The Nursery}

\begin{stagedir}
The night nursery of the Darling family,
which is the scene of our opening Act,
is at the top of a rather depressed street in Bloomsbury.
We have a right to place it where we will,
and the reason Bloomsbury is chosen is that Mr.\@ Roget once lived there.
So did we in days when his \emph{Thesaurus} was our only companion in London;
and we whom he has helped to wend our way through life
have always wanted to pay him a little compliment.
The Darlings therefore lived in Bloomsbury.
