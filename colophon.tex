This book was typeset with the \LaTeX\ typesetting system created by Leslie Lamport,
using the \textsc{memoir} class originally by Peter Wilson.

\emph{\theplaytitle} was set using
the pre-release version 2.0 of
Massimiliano Dominiciâ€™s \textsc{dramatist} package,
and special thanks are due him for his help.

The body text is set in KP-Light by Christophe Caignaert,
from the \textsc{Johannes Kepler} project.
