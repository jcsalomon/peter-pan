\ccPublicDomain\quad
The play \emph{\thetitle; or \theplaytitle}, written in 1904 and first published in 1928,
and the novel \emph{\thebooktitle}, published in 1911,
have in many jurisdictions entered the public domain;
in other jurisdictions the copyright is still in effect.

See ‹http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter\_and\_Wendy\#Copyright\_status›
for a discussion of the matter.

In 1929 Sir James Barrie assigned the copyright as a gift
to the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London
(now called the Great Ormond Street Hospital).
In the U.K.,
due to the Copyright Designs and Patents Act (CDPA) of 1988,
the hospital has right to royalty in perpetuity
for public performance or commercial publication
even though the copyrights themselves have lapsed.

See ‹http://gosh.org/peterpan› regarding performance rights
of the play
in the U.K. or where the copyright is still valid.

\ccZero\quad
The \LaTeX\ code implementing the layout of this book,
or the HTML+CSS code implementing the layout of the EPUB version,
have been dedicated to the public domain.
